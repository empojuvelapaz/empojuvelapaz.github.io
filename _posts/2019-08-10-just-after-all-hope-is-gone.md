Depression, such a complex word that explains certain times in life. When I first read about YSI Global I was not sure what to do with my life, I was not feeling good with who I was, what I was doing and how much I was trying to help my society. I needed a change.

Back in December 2017 I saw a publication on a Scholarships Facebook page from Bolivia, they published the application information for the YSI program. After reading it, I thought that it was one of the greatest chances I had to use my knowledge and guide my efforts on something bigger.

It’s hard to measure an opportunity when you are not completely conscious about your reality. But if you try hard enough you will find something. I used to think that I wasn't good enough for anything but sometimes taking some battles that you might think are lost end up being the best wins in your life.

After passing the first phase of the application process, selecting around 1500 from 8000+ applicants I thought that was the farthest I was going to reach. Full of fears I continued with the process, filling all the information I could and being positive and realistic about what I was able to do. I did not check my mail after that, thinking that that was the end of the story. When I finally did I saw a mail telling me that I was one of the 200 selected ones that were going for a final phase to get to the 21 chosen. I did not get into the group of 21 selected. As my expectations fell into the great abyss of lack of confidence I needed a break to rethink the things. As I was reflecting on the things I had learned during the application process, like the SDGs, entrepreneurship and so on I understood that no matter how hard the situation is, there will always be people who want a change and it is possible to make. Some months later while working on my daily tasks, I received a mail from one of the teams who wanted to have an interview with me to possible add me in the team, as I was one of the 200 selected people. After some discussions they decided to add me in the team, I was ready to start a new journey.

A journey that has not ended yet. The journey for working towards quality education. And it only started the day that I forced myself to continue working despite the fears in my mind.

Don’t think that you are not good enough, if so, work to become the person you want to be. Don't be so harsh with yourself. I never had imagine that I was going to be included in one team in the program but here I am.

And now, I can say for sure that the YSI program has taught me so many things, in few words, confront my fears, dream bigger, be hopeful, work harder and to change the world. There are people outside who want to help, who want to understand, who want to collaborate. Be one of them.

Also, during the last 2 weeks of the program, in Oslo, my team was able to learn so much about entrepreneurship. We could meet many CEOs of various companies, young people who were motivated enough to believe in a positive change. The team was able to create a stronger connection to be more productive and honest between each other.

Now, the new participants are in Oslo and their projects are amazing! I was lucky enough to support some of the projects as a "Buddy" and I hope the very best for them.

It is time to start your own journey.
